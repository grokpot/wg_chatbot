# SennWG Chatbot

To help us remind to move our lazy asses.

## Architecture
The bot is owned by one person and runs on Heroku.  
Heroku access can be granted via email.  
Environment variables are set in GITHUB as *environment secrets* and transferred to Heroku.   
This means:
```diff
- only make changes to Github secrets, Heroku config vars are overwritten on commit!
```

When code is updated, a Github Action runs and deploys the updated code to Heroku.

The following env vars are required in Github under the `production` environment:
- `HEROKU_API_KEY`: The account-associated API key
- `HEROKU_RYANS_EMAIL`: The account email address
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: The bot API token (see `Bot Setup`)
- `TELEGRAM_DEV_CHAT_ID`: The dev/test chat ID
  - note this is still included in the Github "production" environment
  - this is simply just another chat for testing commands and not spamming WG chat members
- `TELEGRAM_WG_CHAT_ID`: The actual "production" chat ID
- `IMGFLIP_USERNAME`: Used for memes, currently Ryan owns the account
- `IMGFLIP_PASSWORD`: Used for memes, currently Ryan owns the account

### Redis
Why include a redis server? Heroku periodically restarts apps, which means if we want to monitor new deployments and notify the dev channel "Hey there's a new deployment", we have to somehow maintain state to say new â‰  old.  
We store the old Github commit SHA in Redis so when the server starts up, it checks if the environment variable `GITHUB_COMMIT_SHA` is equal to what is stored in Redis.  
If not, we notify that a new deployment has taken place.  
If so, we know Heroku has restarted the dyno and it's not a new deployment.

Instead of using Redis, we could probably call Heroku API to unset a config var, but updating config vars in Heroku restarts the dyno, which gets tricky.


## Bot Setup
Telegram has a bot factory user name "BotFather". Steps to setting up a new bot:
1. Message "BotFather"
2. Type `/mybots` to check if bots already exist
3. Type `/newbot` to create a new bot and follow instructions
4. Type `/mybots`, select the new bot, and click `API Token` to generate a new token
5. Copy token into Heroku config var `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
6. For a dev chat environment, create a group and [get the ID](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id_), and copy it to the heroku config `TELEGRAM_DEV_CHAT_ID`
7. For a prod environment, create a group, get the ID, and copy it to the heroku config `TELEGRAM_WG_CHAT_ID`

## Local development

### Setup
```
# Create venv for pip
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install reqs
pip install -r requirements/dev-top.txt

# Install pre-commit (you only need to do this once)
pre-commit install

Add a `.env` file to your directory with the following keys and values:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=VALUE
TELEGRAM_DEV_CHAT_ID=VALUE
TELEGRAM_WG_CHAT_ID=VALUE
REDIS_TLS_URL=VALUE
```

Turn off the bot on Heroku [Telegram doesn't allow multiple instances](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/heroku-wg-chatbot/resources)  
Click the edit icon, toggle the switch, save
